The dashboard files populated into the main folder instead of their own folder for some reason.

To utilize the custom dashboard:
1. Open the 2015 Robot Dashboard project.
2. Build Specifications -> FRC_Dashboard - Right Click and select Build
3. After completion, go to Labview Data/Builds
4. Copy the FRC Dashboard Folder to wherever the dashboard is stored on the computer being used as the driver station
	- For example, mine is C:\Program Files (x86)
	- Copy AND OVERWRITE the old FRC Dashboard folder.

BEFORE running the Autonomous mode, verify the encoder values being returned to the driver station. When the robot is moving forward, BOTH must be negative for the autonomous I wrote to work.
If they aren't, the encoders need to be adjusted in the begin.vi so that they both go the same direction count-wise.
